## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Treat AI agents as actual "teammates"
- Give them voice, task logs, memory per opportunity

### 2. Integrate Proposal + Post-Award planning
- No platform currently bridges pre-award and post-award well

### 3. Use insights to recommend "what to bid next"
- Eventually move from reactive to proactive intelligence

### 4. Offer downloadable artifacts per phase
- Pre-bid report, price model, staffing export, compliance brief

### 5. Multi-tenant readiness
- Allow white-labeling or agency-side client access (e.g., teaming partners)
