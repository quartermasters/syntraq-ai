🧾 Proposal Management Engine (PME)
(Core layer of Proposal Workspace)

🎯 Purpose
To provide a central control system for transforming validated opportunities into completed proposals — while ensuring no critical data, approvals, or documents are missing before writing begins.

🧭 Workflow Position
The PME is triggered only after:

Opportunity has been marked “Go”

Market Research, Financial Viability, Resource Planning, and CAH modules are completed or confirmed

AI-based readiness checklist passes or flags gaps

✅ Step 1: Proposal Readiness Review (PRR)
Component	Description
📄 Data Completeness Scan	Scans metadata, summary, documents, pricing inputs, resource links
🧠 AI Compliance Gate	Flags missing Section L/M elements, attachments, pricing files
📝 Resource Linkage Check	Ensures assigned staff and vendors are confirmed
🧾 CAH Backloop	Buttons to trigger quote/NDA/reminder from inside PME
📋 Final Go Confirmation	Team lead or CEO must approve before moving forward

If any of the above fails → return to CAH or prior module for resolution
