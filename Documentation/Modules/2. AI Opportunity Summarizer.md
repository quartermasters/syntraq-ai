🧠 AI Opportunity Summarizer – Detailed Specification
🎯 Purpose
Enable company leadership to make informed Go/No-Go decisions in under 30 seconds per opportunity — using AI to instantly summarize only relevant opportunities from the Unified Opportunity Feed (UOF), customized to their business profile.

🧩 Core Role in Workflow
Step	Action
1️⃣	UOF filters out irrelevant opportunities (set-asides, NAICS mismatch, location filters)
2️⃣	Summarizer generates a tailored brief per matching opportunity
3️⃣	CEO/user reads summary and clicks Go / No-Go / Save for Review
4️⃣	AI updates company learning profile based on user behavior

Exclusions:

Set-asides not applicable (e.g., “Indian Tribes Only”, “NATO” if not qualified)
