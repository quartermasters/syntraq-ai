👥 AI Role-Based Team Simulation (ARTS)
Submodule of the Proposal Workspace

🎯 Purpose
To simulate and execute proposal development using a virtual team of AI agents, each representing a traditional GovCon proposal role — automating, accelerating, and enhancing every part of the proposal lifecycle.

These AI agents are not just co-pilots — they are autonomous teammates.

🧩 Core AI Roles & Their Functions
AI Role	Responsibilities
🧠 Capture Lead AI	Interprets opportunity data, suggests strategy, go/no-go decisions, and flags fit risks
✍️ Proposal Writer AI	Drafts narrative sections, rewrites content, matches tone and RFP language
🛡️ Compliance Officer AI	Maps Section L/M requirements, validates structure, flags T&Cs or missing forms
💸 Pricing Analyst AI	Builds budget models, cost narratives, cost realism checks, connects with FVM
🕵️‍♂️ Research Analyst AI	Gathers past performance, competitor insight, teaming suggestions
🗂️ Document Manager AI	Tracks attachments, resume completeness, SF forms, compliance certs
🔎 Proposal Reviewer AI	Reviews narrative drafts for clarity, logic, grammar, persuasiveness, and alignment
⏱️ Project Scheduler AI	Manages timeline, progress bars, alerts, and writer load balancing

🧠 AI Agent Behaviors
Simulation Feature	Description
🧩 Task Assignment	Each section or document has one or more AI roles assigned (e.g., Writer + Reviewer)
⛓️ Chain of Action	Proposal Writer → Reviewer → Compliance Officer → Final Check
🔁 Iteration Loops	Writer and Reviewer go through multiple revision cycles until quality passes threshold
🧾 Agent Memory	Each agent retains project-specific knowledge to ensure continuity
🔐 Human-in-the-Loop	Human users can override or co-edit any AI work at any stage

🛠️ Task Execution Examples

🛡️ Governance & Control
Setting	Control
Agent Autonomy Level	Full Auto / Semi-Auto / Read-Only
Review Thresholds	Require human approval above certain dollar size or contract type
Agent Credentials	Attach resumes/avatars to AI output for traceability
Custom Prompts	Tailor prompts per agency (e.g., DOD, GSA, VA writing style)
