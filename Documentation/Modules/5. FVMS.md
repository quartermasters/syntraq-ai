üí∞ Financial Viability & Management System (FVMS)
üéØ Expanded Purpose
Beyond just assessing a single contract‚Äôs ROI, the FVMS now functions as a centralized financial control tower ‚Äî helping small GovCon companies manage cash, forecast budgets, handle contract-specific and company-wide finances, link accounts, and prepare for audits and pricing compliance.

It evolves from a bid-time estimator into a full financial operations assistant.
